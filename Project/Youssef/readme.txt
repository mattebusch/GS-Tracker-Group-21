Custom Profiles (Sports, RPG, Shooter);

latest changes:

fixed keyboard not showing up in "add game profile" dialog

realized "bug" with last item not showing up in sports game list is due to
the way android lays out gridviews and after toying around with the xml for
a long time gave up and created a workaround by inserting a dummy field as
the last item in the list

created dummy activities for rpg and shooter activities and linked them to the
GSCustom main activity

finished sports and rpg profiles
